My recipe website.

Building my first website which showcases different recipes.
This is going to be a bear bone website (for now) as i am just 
using HTML.

I hope by the end of the project, I will demonstrate clearly:
    1. understanding of basic HTML tags and element
    2. will be able to create and functional website with 
    working links and images.
    3. will be able to commit the project to git and also
    keep good record of commit messages through each commit.

I am excited for the journey ahead knowing ts s where it all 
begins. Follow me along and see my progress down the line. Hey!
maybe you will help by holding me to account.
